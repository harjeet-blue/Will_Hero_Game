## Getting Started -

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources  ( has all the .java and .fxml files)
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies 
- `images`: the folder to store all the images
- `SavedGames`: the folder to store the savedgames ( during serialization )
- `css`: the folder to maintain all css files
- `bin`: the folder maintain binary or exe files (not to worry about this floder only contains compiles files)
Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be
found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
